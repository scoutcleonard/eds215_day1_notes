###Introducting the Shell

- Shell: a type of commend interpreter

- Command Interpreter: runs lines using REPL patttern. command is listed in the first part of the line, than the data that command is using. 

- REPL: read, evaluate, print, loop. computers store data and run commands using that data using this patter. 

*the shell interprets any amount of white space as just a single space*
